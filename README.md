Facial features tracking for deception detection
Research Work on detecting deception in Human Beings Deception detection Predictions of high-level micro-expressions can be used as features for deception prediction.

The ability of humans to detect deception is very limited. In (Bond Jr and DePaulo 2006), it was reported that the average accuracy of detecting lies without special aids is 54%, which is only slightly better than chance. To detect deception more accurately, physiological methods have been developed.

However, physiological methods such as the Polygraph, or more recent functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) based methods are not always correlated with deception (Farah et al. 2014). Additionally, the cost of the equipment and the overt nature of the method make the utility of these devices limited for real-life deception detection Feature contributing to judge person

1)facial micro expression (like eye frown , lip movement)

2)audio analysis(mel-frequency spectrum)

3)body language

4)transcripts

5)Eye dilation (not much evidence )

Some method we can explore : For micro expression feature- Improved dense trajectory , HOG (histogram of oriented gradients), HOF (histogram of optical flow) , MBH (motion bountary histogram), other CNN based method. For audio features - MFCC (Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients), GNN ( gaussian mixed model)

Methods such as eigen faces , Principal component analysis used to reduce dimensionality can be used.
